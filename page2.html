            How long are you awake in the morning before you go online? Perhaps
            it’s while you’re still lying in bed, using a news feed or social
            media as the needed stimulant to push you out from under the covers.
            Or maybe you wait to open your device until after a warm shower and
            cup of coffee. If you use sleep tracking apps, you might say you
            never signed off in the first place.<br />
            <br />
            And, like millions of others during the pandemic, the internet is
            probably what enabled you to stay in touch with family, or complete
            entire years of work and/or school remotely. If this sounds
            familiar, then you live in a part of the world where an internet
            connection now counts as an essential utility — one that’s as easy
            to take for granted as the natural gas heating your shower water or
            the electricity powering your coffee maker.<br />
            <br />

            But if you think we’re hyperconnected today, just wait. Globally,
            just over 55% of today’s households have an internet connection.
            This gap between the internet haves and have-nots is referred to as
            the digital divide, and access is skewed toward richer nations. The
            gap is projected to close in the next decade as billions of homes
            connect to the internet for the first time and by 2030 it’s
            estimated that the technology industry could account for 20% of the
            global electricity demand. This presents a troublesome dichotomy. On
            one hand, it supports livelihoods, educations, and bolsters the
            global economy; on the other hand, the increased usage of the apps,
            websites, and services that we build will place an even greater
            strain on our already-overloaded power grids.
